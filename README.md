The project "Harmony-Pilates" aims to promote an active lifestyle, particularly targeting individuals who work from home and spend prolonged periods sitting. Pilates, a form of exercise that involves controlled movements, not only strengthens muscles but also provides effective body stretching and enhances mental stability. It emphasizes the significance of movement in leading a fulfilling life. With this website, my intention is to raise awareness and understanding of pilates among people. By exploring the website, users will gain insights into the importance of balance and vitality in their lives.
