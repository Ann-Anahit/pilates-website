# pilates-website
The project "Harmony-Pilates" aims to promote an active lifestyle, particularly targeting individuals who work from home and spend prolonged periods sitting. Pilates, a form of exercise that involves controlled movements, not only strengthens muscles but also provides effective body stretching and enhances mental stability. It emphasizes the significance of movement in leading a fulfilling life. With this website, my intention is to raise awareness and understanding of pilates among people. By exploring the website, users will gain insights into the importance of balance and vitality in their lives.

## Design

### Website Structure

The website consists of a 7-page website, with 5 pages navigable via the navigation bar and the seventh being a customized page to inform the user that the content of the form has been submitted. The home page is the default loading page. The logo is in the top left corner and the menu is in the top right corner. This navigation bar on small screen devices ends up centralizing the three elements and the menu becomes a dropdown menu.

### Wireframes

I create the wireframes with the Balsamiq Wireframes.

### Color Scheme

- I used the color `#603F8B` in the navigation bar, for my logo and the icons in the bottom. 
- As secondary color I used `#FCD8C5` in the navigation bar.
- At the bottom is a padding in this `#E0FFFF` color.
- As text color I used `333333`.

### Typography

The font I chose to use is [playfair-display](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts/playfair-display?subsets=latin) from Google Fonts and as a fall back font, sans-serif.

This website includes 7 pages and all of them are responsive. They are: Home, About, History, Videos, Contact, Form Submitted und privacy policy. On each page we have:

- A favicon.<br>

- A navigation bar

### The Home Page

On the home page the user will find the message **Welcome to our pilates website** which clearly gives the idea of what the website is about.Also the background picture shows a person doing pilates.
