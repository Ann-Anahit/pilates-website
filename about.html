                <h2>What is Pilates?</h2>
                <p>Many people initially think of Pilates as a special form of yoga, just without the downward dog pose
                    and the concluding "Om." Slow, not very strenuous, and especially suitable for women - these and
                    other
                    prejudices persist. However, Pilates exercises can be extremely demanding and just as effective
                    under proper guidance, similar to a session of functional training or HIIT.
                    Pilates combines full-body training - exercises like crunches, forearm or side plank, standing
                    balance, and pelvic tilts - with a flowing breath. One connects the exhale with the contraction, and
                    the
                    inhale occurs synchronously with the relaxation. This is intended to strengthen the body and calm
                    the mind.
                    The focus is always on the core, the so-called "Powerhouse": From the ribs to the pelvis, all
                    muscles in
                    the upper body are strengthened through slow, highly concentrated movements.
                    The inventor of this holistic workout is Joseph Hubertus Pilates. He gained recognition during World
                    War I for training the sick in the hospital in a way that helped them recover faster. For this, he
                    developed a large wooden frame with springs - visually a mix of a stretching board and a rowing
                    machine. This
                    equipment, in its modern form known as the Reformer, is still used in many Pilates studios today.
                    Pilates is an intense but gentle strength training focusing on the core. Here you will find all the
                    information about the training method and the best tips for beginners.</p>
                <h2>What does Pilates train?</h2>
                <p>Those familiar with Pilates are likely aware of the term Powerhouse. This refers to the body's center
                    that participants activate at the beginning of each Pilates exercise.
                    The Powerhouse is the powerhouse of our body. It's no coincidence that Joseph Hubertus Pilates'
                    motto was "All strength comes from the core."
                    The Powerhouse includes the entire abdominal muscles - front, side, and back abdominal walls - as
                    well as the pelvic floor and lower back muscles.
                    What makes Pilates so effective: You not only train the superficial muscles but also specifically
                    target your deep muscles. At the same time, your muscles in the upper and lower body also work,
                    making
                    Pilates the ideal full-body workout.</p>
                <h3>These are the additional positive effects of Pilates:</h3>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You define your muscles and strengthen your entire body without straining the joints.
                        </li>
                        <li>You improve your posture.</li>
                        <li>You increase your overall flexibility.
                        </li>
                        <li>You prevent complaints, especially in the hip and shoulder areas.
                        </li>
                        <li>You develop a better body awareness.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Pilates is particularly effective when combined with a balanced diet rich in protein, carbohydrates,
                    and
                    essential vitamins and minerals. For your daily dose of vitamins, consider using Daily Vitamins or
                    Vitamin Drops.</p>
                <h2>Pilates Exercises: The Six Principles </h2>
                <p>Each Pilates session follows six fundamental principles that its founder, Joseph Pilates, worked
                    with.
                    They are inspired by Eastern training methods such as martial arts and yoga:
                </p>
                <p><strong>Centering:</strong> The stabilization of the core is the focus. Every Pilates exercise and
                    movement begins with activating the core.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Breathing:</strong> A calm, flowing breath synchronized with the movements ensures adequate
                    oxygen
                    supply to the muscles.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Control:</strong> Movements in Pilates are slow, deliberate, and controlled. The goal is
                    always a
                    technically flawless execution while engaging the core.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Concentration:</strong> Attention in Pilates is on the working muscles and breathing. This
                    helps
                    to execute the movements precisely and with focus.</p>
                <p><strong>Precision:</strong> Each Pilates exercise has a specific sequence with clear instructions. It
                    is
                    essential to follow these as precisely as possible, following the motto "quality over quantity."
                </p>
                <p><strong>Flow of Movement:</strong> In Pilates, there is always a flow. This is achieved through
                    dynamic
                    transitions between exercises and the flowing breath. Each participant can determine the tempo of
                    the
                    movements.
                </p>
                <p>The exercises you can expect in Pilates include dynamic movements like crunches, arm and leg lifts in
                    a
                    tabletop position, or the shoulder bridge with pelvic tilts. Additionally, there are static holds,
                    such
                    as plank variations like forearm and side planks or the V-sit with extended legs and a reclined
                    upper
                    body.
